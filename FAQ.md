# FAQ

**Q:** Will you fix game X?<br/>
**A:** I would love to! Unfortunately my resources are severely limited as I'm a one-man team. I will give it a try, but if you can link me to a commit in any other fork fixing the game I'd be glad to cherry-pick it.

**Q:** Will you add feature X?<br/>
**A:** Most likely, no. I hesitate from adding complex features that may jeopardize stability and introduce bugs. Such features would only be added behind a settings toggle.

**Q:** You're only doing this for fame/money/...<br/>
**A:** At the moment I am not considering to take any donations. I won't need them anyways in the foreseeable future.
About the fame thing, I kind of dislike the attention. It distracts me from doing actual work, and it makes me feel pressured.

**Q:** What happens if Nintendo DMCAs the repo?<br/>
**A:** The main repository is on the Tor network. That means Nintendo can do no harm to it unless they manage to deanonymize me and send me a personal letter. I'm doing my best to avoid that.
Whenever a mirror repository gets taken down, I'll just move on to another git service. Yes, they are finite but I've got enough to hopefully make them give up before I've depleted my list.

**Q:** But you're just stealing changes from other forks!<br/>
**A:** This is a pretty normal thing to do in the open source world. Yes, a lot of the changes are cherry-picked from other forks. There is no point in duplicating work unnecessarily and keeping good additions out of the project just because they are not mine. Original contributors are always credited as commit author of course.
Note however that all changes listed in the README file are the work of Torzu contributors and other forks should feel free to cherry-pick them!

**Q:** Will there ever be an Android version?<br/>
**A:** Unfortunately I am pretty inexperienced in the Android world. This whole gradle stuff makes no sense to me and I've given up for now.
Let's say, it'd be a nice bonus but it's very low priority. If you'd like to run Yuzu on Android you'd probably be better off with Sudachi. I'm [looking for people interested in helping out](http://vub63vv26q6v27xzv2dtcd25xumubshogm67yrpaz2rculqxs7jlfqad.onion/torzu-emu/torzu/issues/20)!

**Q:** This fork is going to be abandoned very soon!<br/>
**A:** I have committed myself to at the very least keep it updated enough to compile and run on modern systems for the next decade or so. If you don't see commits for a while it doesn't mean I've abandoned it.
I have ADHD and need to shift my focus between different projects sometimes to stay motivated. Also, personal life is a thing. ~~Who knows maybe I'll be run over by a car tomorrow? Joking, that's not going to happen. Hopefully.~~

**Q:** Why don't you reply on Reddit?
**A:** Reddit doesn't like the way I anonymize my connection and heavily restricts my actions. Whenever I post something, it's immediately flagged and deleted. The `r/torzu` subreddit isn't mine, I was just given moderator privileges to it.

Enjoy playing your favorite (and legally obtained) Nintendo games on whatever device and emulator you prefer!<br/>
Don't let Nintendo pressure you into using their kind of terrible and overpriced hardware... I'm truly sorry if no emulator can currently play the game you want to play.

Finally, enjoy life, make the most of it, don't be a ~~couch~~ office chair potato like me. Tip, even if you are, a walk around the green city areas can be incredibly refreshing!
